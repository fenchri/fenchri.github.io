I am an NLP Research Scientist at [Huawei Noah's Ark](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) lab based in London.

My current interests lie in the intersection of natural and programming languages and how we can develop models that effectively handle both modalities. I am also interested in improving LLMs reasoning capabilities via memory mechanisms and continual learning taking inspiration from human cognition.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/) group of the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), where I also obtained my PhD, advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou). During this time, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/). My research focused mainly on information extraction by recognising relations between named entities within and across sentences in fully- and distantly-supervised settings.

Prior to my PhD, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) (BEng & MEng).
